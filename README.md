# Validation Rules

A collection of validation rules. It's highly likely I'll keep adding to it.

They're designed to be used with Laravel, but so long as you don't mind having `illuminate\support` as a dependency, you could also use them outside of it.

## Installation

```php
composer require lukaswhite/validation-rules
```

* Latitude
* Longitude
